Q8: What are HTML & CSS?
A: HTML is a markup language,
CSS is a styling language.

Q9: What’s an algorithm?
A: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

Q10: What is flowchart?
A: A flowchart is simply a graphical representation of steps. It shows steps in sequential order and is widely used in presenting the flow of algorithms, workflow or processes. Typically, a flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.

Q11: What are variables?
A:variables are symbolic name for information, information contained by variables is represented by name of the variables.

Q12: What are loops?
A: Loops are sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

Q13: Compiler vs Interpreter?
A: Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Whereas, compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

Q14: What is Machine Code?
A: Machine code (MC) is the executable instruction code provided by all running computer system programs and applications. MC language is a low-level code interpreted and converted from high-level source code and understood only by the machine.

Q15: Name some HTML tags
A: <!DOCTYPE> , <html> , <head>, <title>, <body>, <p>, <br>, <footer>

Q16: What are ternary operators? Write syntax.
A: The ternary operator is employed to execute code supported the results of a binary condition. It takes during a binary condition as input, which makes it almost like an 'if-else' control flow block. It also, however, returns a worth , behaving almost like a function.

   Syntax: result = binaryCondition ? valueReturnedIfTrue : valueReturnedIfFalse;


Q17: What are jumping statements? Name them.
A:Jump statements are used to alter the flow of loop when you want to skip a part of the loop or want to terminate the loop
in other words  they transfer the program execution control to specific statements 
jump statements are:
1 goto
2 continue
3 return


Q18: How many types of operator are there?Name them.
A:There are 8types of operator .
1. Unary      . eg: expr++ , expr--
2. Arithmetic . eg: * , / , % , + , -
3. Shift      . eg: << , >> , >>>
4. Relational . eg: == , !=
5. Bitwise    . eg: & , ^ ,|
6. Logical    . eg: && , || , ? :
7. Ternary    . eg: ? :
8. Assignment . eg:  = , += , -= , *= , /= , %= , &= , ^= , |= , <<= , >>= , >>>=

Q19: Difference between / and // in python language.
A: /  is Float Division eturns a floating point approximation of the result of a division. For eg : 1/3 = 0.333333333
   // is Integer division returns the floor of the division.  For eg : 1//3 = 0


Q20: Input a number n using C .
A:scanf("%d",&n);


Q21: A macro can execute faster than a function.Is this statement true or false?
A: TRUE, Because in function, much of time is used to take control from function call to called function and much of time is spent in this process,
         Whereas in macro expression are directly replaced in the source code.


Q22: The prototype of a function can be used to perform what on function
A: It is used to perform type checking on function calls.


Q23: Which library function can convert an integer/long to a string?
A:In java,we can use:
          Integer.toString(variable)

Q24: What is "JVM" in java programming language?
A: "JVM" stands for java virtual machine.Java virtual machine is an abstract machine and is a part of the JRE(Java Runtime Enviroment).It enables a computer to run java programs as well as programs written in any other languages.In other programming languages,the compiler produces a machine code for a particular system but in java JVM converts java byte code into machine language.


Q25: Is Python the Future of Programming?
Ans: Python will be the language of the future. Testers will have to upgrade their skills and learn these languages to tame the AI and ML tools.
     The python language has managed to exceed other languages. 
     Thus, it has an extensive set of prospects that can be taken care of, in upcoming years. There are various companies that are majorly dependent on python language developers to boost user experience.

           if(a[mid]==key)            //key is element to search
            {
             printf("element %d is found at %d position:",key,mid+1);
             exit(o);
            }
            else if(a[mid]>key)

            {
              for(j=0;j<n-i-1;j++)        //comparision
              { 
               if(a[j] > a[j+1])          //swap
                {
                 temp = a[j];
                  a[j] = a[j+1];
                  a[j+1] = temp;
                 }
               }
              //the array is sorted
              
          
         c. Pallindrome number
            int n,rev=0,num,remainder;    // rev is for reversing the number 
            scanf("%d",&num);             //enter the number
            n=num;
            while(num !=0)
            {
              remainder = num %10;
              num=num/10;
              rev= rev*10 + remainder;   //reversing the number
             }
              if(rev==n)                 //comparing the reversed number to the original number
              //if rev is equal to n the number is pallindrome
